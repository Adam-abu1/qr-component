## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Whilst this was a **very** simple start to getting back to coding there were a few thing for me to reinforce
- The use of the `box-sizing css property to remember how total area is calculated when taking padding and widths/heights into account
- Setting the root font size to 62.5% to allow for rem units to default for 10px for better
